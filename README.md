# Weather App

## What it is

This is a web page that allows you to search the weather for any city.

## Where it is

The live deployment of this weather search is located here <https://juliet2319.github.io/weather-app>

## How to use it

On the page header enter the city you'd like to search the weather for. Submit the city and the current weather and five day forecast will populate.

The toggle previous searches button on the header will hide or reveal the side bar with the previously searched cities.

Clicking on any previously searched city's button will change the displayed weather and forecast to that city.

If you leave the page and return, the most recently searched city's weather will be displayed.
